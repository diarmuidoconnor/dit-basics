## Exercise

Recall, in the [Mocha lab][lab] we refactored the removeProductByName and checkReorder methods. __You are required__ to apply these changes __as the next two separate commits__ to the repo, using these exact commit messages :

1. "Refactored removeProductByName"
1.  "Refactored checkReorder"

Details of the refactoring can be found [here][remove] and [here][check]

-------------------

#### When completed, create a zip of the `gitBasics` folder and submit it to Moodle for assessment BUT PLEASE DELETE THE node_modules FOLDER BEFORE ZIPPING (it significantly reduces file size)

------------------------

#### Ex 2
The 'git diff' command has many options/arguments. Use it to discover the precise file changes that happened between two specific commits, say the commit labeled  "RemoveProductByName tested" and the one labeled "CheckReorder and updateStock implemented and tested"
