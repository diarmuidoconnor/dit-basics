## Start-up.

Unzip [this archive][start] - it contains the initial file structure for the Catalogue project. Import the project into VS Code, open an integrated terminal in the editor and create a local Git repository (repo), with the command:
~~~
$ git init
~~~

![][init]

The command created a new sub-folder called `.git` - this is the local repository.

![][repo]

Let's make sure everything works before continuing:
~~~
$ npm install
$ npm run test
~~~

Returning to Git, its important that we do not commit/add certain types of files to a repository, including:

+ 3rd party libraries
+ Generated files, e.g. .log, .class (Java)
+ Operating System filesystem management files
+ IDE/Editor configuration files.

To safeguard against their inclusion __at the start of a project we must__ create a special file in the project base folder (`labGitBasics`), called `.gitignore` (the . prefix is important). For this simple project initialize it to:
~~~
/node_modules
/.vscode
*.log
package-lock.json
.DS_Store*
~~~
Now type the command:
~~~
$ git status
~~~
The response shows the 'status' of the project's working directory: the files/folders that will be added to the repo the next time we perform a commit. VS Code has excellent support for git, The screenshot lists all the files (5) 5 that will be added to the repo: 

![][vscode]

As a simple illustration of gitignore's role, comment out the file's first line and notice how many file could now be (incorrectly) added to the repo:

![][gitignore]

__UNDO THE CHANGE TO .gitignore__

Now perform the first commit, with these commands:
~~~
$ git add -A 
$ git commit -m "Initial project structure"
~~~
This stores the initial version of the project to the local repository - sometimes referred to as version 0. Notice, the status of the project's working directory now indicates their are no files to be added to the repository - the repository and working directory are __in sync__.

As we progress through this lab we will make changes to the working directory by editing and adding new files. These changes need to be __committed__ (saved) to the repo to retain the 'in sync' status.
