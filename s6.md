# Exercise

Recall, in the [Mocha lab](https://moodle.wit.ie/pluginfile.php/4851486/mod_resource/content/3/index.html) we refactored the removeProductByName and checkReorder methods. **You are required** to apply these changes **as the next two separate commits** to the repo, using these exact commit messages :

1. "Refactored removeProductByName"
2. "Refactored checkReorder"

Details of the refactoring can be found [here](https://moodle.wit.ie/pluginfile.php/4851486/mod_resource/content/3/sections/s3.html) and [here](https://moodle.wit.ie/pluginfile.php/4851486/mod_resource/content/3/sections/s41.html)

## When completed, create a zip of the `gitBasics` folder and submit it to Moodle for assessment BUT PLEASE DELETE THE node\_modules FOLDER BEFORE ZIPPING \(it significantly reduces file size\)

## Ex 2

The 'git diff' command has many options/arguments. Use it to discover the precise file changes that happened between two specific commits, say the commit labeled "RemoveProductByName tested" and the one labeled "CheckReorder and updateStock implemented and tested"
