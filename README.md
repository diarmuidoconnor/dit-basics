# Introduction

## Git basics.

In this lab we will explore the basic commands of the Git tool for managing the version history of a software project's code-base. For convenience, the Product Catalogue mini-project from an earlier lab \(Unit testing\) will serve as the context. Since the focus of this lab is Git, the JS code being developed is not discussed/explained as we already are very familiar with it - you will simply be 'cutting and pasting' to files. What is important is knowing how to use Git to track what files are changing.
